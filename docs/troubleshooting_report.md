# Kuber-Cron Troubleshooting Report

## Overview
This document details the issues encountered during the development and deployment of the Kuber-Cron application, along with their resolutions.

## Issues and Resolutions

### 1. Container CrashLoopBackOff Issues

#### Problem 1.1: CronItem Test Method Error
**Symptoms:**
- Pods repeatedly crashing with CrashLoopBackOff status
- Error logs showing: `AttributeError: 'CronItem' object has no attribute 'test'`
- Multiple pod restarts observed in deployment history

**Root Cause:**
- The scheduler was attempting to use a non-existent `test()` method on the CronItem class
- This caused the application to crash on startup

**Resolution:**
1. Modified the scheduler code to use the correct method for checking job schedules
2. Changed from using `job.test(time.time())` to checking if the next scheduled time is within the next 60 seconds
3. Updated the job scheduling logic to use proper time comparison

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before
if job.is_enabled() and job.test(time.time()):

# After
if job.is_enabled():
    next_time = job.next(time.time())
    if next_time and next_time <= time.time() + 60:
```

#### Problem 1.2: Missing Crontab Program
**Symptoms:**
- Error messages: `Can't read crontab; No crontab program '/usr/bin/crontab'`
- Jobs not executing despite being enabled
- Continuous error logging about missing crontab program

**Root Cause:**
- The Docker container was missing the cron package
- Using a slim Python image without system utilities

**Resolution:**
1. Added `cron` package to the Dockerfile installation
2. Modified Dockerfile to include necessary system dependencies
3. Updated the container image to include required system utilities

**Dockerfile Changes:**
```dockerfile
# Before
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libpq-dev \
    default-libmysqlclient-dev

# After
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libpq-dev \
    default-libmysqlclient-dev \
    cron
```

### 2. Poetry Installation Issues

#### Problem 2.1: Poetry Path Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Poetry installer error logs
- Failed dependency installation
- Container failing to build

**Root Cause:**
- Poetry wasn't properly added to the system PATH
- Microsoft repository conflicts in the Dockerfile

**Resolution:**
1. Added Poetry to system PATH using symlink
2. Removed unnecessary Microsoft SQL Server dependencies
3. Simplified the Dockerfile to focus on essential components

**Dockerfile Changes:**
```dockerfile
# Before
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# After
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - \
    && ln -s /root/.local/bin/poetry /usr/local/bin/poetry
```

### 3. Resource Management Issues

#### Problem 3.1: Resource Cleanup
**Symptoms:**
- Multiple terminated pods in the system
- Stale Docker resources
- Temporary files accumulating

**Resolution:**
1. Implemented comprehensive cleanup:
   ```bash
   # Remove containers
   docker ps -a | grep kuber-cron | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -r docker rm -f
   
   # Remove images
   docker rmi kuber-cron:latest
   
   # Clean Kubernetes resources
   kubectl delete deployment kuber-cron --ignore-not-found
   
   # Remove temporary files
   rm -rf __pycache__ */__pycache__ *.pyc *.pyo *.pyd .pytest_cache .coverage htmlcov dist build *.egg-info
   ```

### 4. Current Status

#### Working Components:
- Basic scheduler functionality
- Prometheus metrics server
- Job configuration loading
- Logging system

#### Remaining Issues:
- Job execution verification needs improvement
- Need to implement proper job status tracking
- Metrics collection could be enhanced

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
- Implement more robust error handling for job execution
- Add retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Improve logging for debugging purposes

### 2. Resource Management
- Implement automatic cleanup of old logs
- Add resource limits for job execution
- Implement job timeout mechanisms

### 3. Monitoring
- Enhance Prometheus metrics
- Add job execution history
- Implement better health checks

### 4. Configuration
- Add validation for crontab entries
- Implement configuration hot-reload
- Add support for environment variables in job configurations

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Container Configuration
- Always verify system dependencies in Dockerfile
- Keep container images minimal but functional
- Test container builds locally before deployment

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment
- Monitor pod status and logs regularly
- Implement proper health checks
- Use appropriate resource limits

### 3. Development Process
- Test changes in a controlled environment
- Maintain proper logging for debugging
- Keep documentation updated with changes

## Conclusion
The system is now in a more stable state after addressing the major issues. The fixes implemented have resolved the core functionality problems, though there are still areas for improvement in terms of reliability and functionality. The documentation of these issues and their resolutions will help prevent similar problems in future development and deployment cycles.
